# Welcome...
... to my dev blog!

# What should I do next?
* Update `title`, `description`, and `footer.text` in `content/site.json` to set the blog title, description, and (optional) footer/copyright notice
* Consider adding a `url` property to `content/site.json` (this will make md2blog generate absolute URLs iny our Atom feed)
  * Make sure the URL ends with a `/`
* Create directories in `content/posts/` for each topic, then author posts in those directories
  * Remember that you can add additional keywords to posts:
